# domed-city
Simple Terraform API wrapper in Ruby.

##Â Purpose

## Naming

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domed_city):

```
...the dome is airtight and pressurized, creating a habitat that can be controlled for air temperature, composition and quality, typically due to an external atmosphere (or lack thereof) that is inimical to habitation for one or more reasons.
```

## Installation

Install manually:

```
$ gem install domed-city
```

or add to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'domed-city'
```

## Usage

For ease of use, type `dome` in the CLI:

```
$ dome

Dome wraps the Terraform API and performs useful stuff.

where [commands] are:
  -p, --plan            Creates a Terraform plan
  -a, --apply           Applies a Terraform plan
