# dome
Simple Terraform API wrapper in Ruby.

##Â Purpose

To consolidate, improve and enforce standards around ITV's use of Terraform (via Rake) across product teams.

## Naming

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domed_city):

```
...the dome is airtight and pressurized, creating a habitat that can be controlled for air temperature, composition and quality, typically due to an external atmosphere (or lack thereof) that is inimical to habitation for one or more reasons.
```
